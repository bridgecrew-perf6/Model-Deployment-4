# Model Deployment

We will visit different steps involved in MLOps pipeline.

> Machine Learning Model Operationalization Management - MLOps, as a DevOps extension, establishes effective practices and processes around designing, building, and deploying ML models into production.

In paper titled [Towards CRISP-ML(Q): A Machine Learning Process Model with Quality Assurance Methodology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05155.pdf), the authors introduce a methodology or a process model for development of ML applications called **CRoss-Industry Standard Process model for the development of Machine Learning applications with Quality assurance methodology (CRISP-ML(Q))**. CRISP-ML(Q) offers ML community a standard process to streamline ML and data science projects making results reproducible. It is designed for development of ML applications where ML model is deployed and maintained as part of product or service.

CRISP-ML(Q) process model consits of 6 phases:

1. Business & Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Modelling
4. Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and Maintenance

For each phase, the flow chart below explains quality assurance approach in CRISP-ML(Q). In the first step, clear objective for the current phase are defined, followed by taking steps to initiate the task, followed by identifying the risks that might negatively impact the efficiency and success of the ML application (e.g., bias, overfitting, lack of reproducibility, etc.), quality assurance methods to mitigate risks when these risks need to be diminished (e.g., cross-validation, documenting process and results, etc.).

## Model Deployment

The ML model deployment includes following tasks :

* Define inference hardware and optimize ML model for target hardware
* Evaluate model under production condition
* Assure user acceptance and usability
* Minimize the risks of unforseen errors
* Deployment strategy

> A wise person on the Internet once said: deploying is easy if you ignore all the hard parts. If you want to deploy a model for your friends to play with, all you have to do is to create an endpoint to your prediction function, push your model to AWS, create an app with Streamlit or Dash. The hard parts include making your model available to millions of users with a latency of milliseconds and 99% uptime, setting up the infrastructure so that the right person can be immediately notified when something went wrong, figuring out what went wrong, and seamlessly deploying the updates to fix whatâ€™s wrong.

## Model Serving and Deployment Patterns

Source: <https://ml-ops.org/content/three-levels-of-ml-software>

Model serving is a way to integrate the ML model in a software system. There are two aspects for deploying ML system in a production environment. First deploying pipeline for automated retraining and second providing endpoint to ingest input data and provide predictions using ML model.

There are 5 popular model serving patterns to put ML model into production

1. Model-as-Service
